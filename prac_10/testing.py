# starting with a capital and ending with a single full stop.
# Important: start with a function header and just use pass as the body

# 'hello' -> 'Hello.'
# 'It is an ex parrot.' -> 'It is an ex parrot.'
# and one more you decide (one that is valid!)
# test this and watch the tests fail
# then write the body of the function so that the tests pass
