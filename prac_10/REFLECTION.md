# Reflection

- regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during
  the course of the subject?
- regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
- regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

My estimates didn't stray too far from reality, towards the end of the subject there were occasions where it took much
longer than expected, though.

Code reviews taught me that reading someone else's code is difficult, and to provide critical analysis to someone's code
can often be as hard as writing it yourself
doing a code review, and seeing a clever way of performing a task let learn from the person who I was reviewing,whilst
at the same time practicing the core skills by doing the review itself

I believe code reviews should be assessed, and due on friday before LearnJCU submission on Sunday, as people often
didn't
bother to review my code until after submission. Furthermore, making the practical marked out of 4 means you can lose a
whole 25% of
your grade for an error in only one component of the weekly workshop. As it stands, a minor error can disproportionately
affect the grade, which is unfair. I would fix this so that if a weekly practical had 5 tasks/components, each
component would be marked out of 4,
making
it much more fair for the student.
